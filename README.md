### Context

The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications. The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is one of the most popular ones. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to read house numbers and match them to their geolocations. This is a great benchmark dataset to play with, learn and train models that accurately identify street numbers, and incorporate into all sorts of projects.

### Objective

The objective of the exercise is to perform an image classification exercise on the given dataset to come up with a model that can help identify the digit images which have issues like picture brightness, blurriness.
